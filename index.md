<b>[Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Using
Auto-encoder]</b>
<br> In this paper, we propose an efficient anomaly detection model based on Auto-encoder
and novel thresholding procedure, using training data reconstruction error percentiles and parameters fine-tuning.

<b>[A Low Inertia Guided Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection in Networks]</b>
<br> The principal idea behind this paper is to emphasize the low Inertia during the feature extraction for anomaly
detection. For this reason, we use an Auto-encoder, and force the hidden layer to project data into low Inertia domain, by
incorporating a regularization term into the Auto-encoder loss function.
